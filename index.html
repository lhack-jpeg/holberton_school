                    <h1>About me</h1>
                    <p>
                        My name is Luke H, I've been studying Information
                        Technology through Tafe NSW and have also been
                        supplementing my learning through
                        <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>. The Tafe
                        Certificate IV in Information Technology has provided me
                        with an elevated overview of the industry, and my own
                        individual studies have assisted in my learning of the
                        latest technologies in web development, databases and
                        styling. I am currently studying React to become a MERN
                        developer in the future.

                    <h1>My Projects</h1>
                    <p>
                        I have created a multiple projects to showcase my
                        capabilities and knowledge. I have utilised modern
                        technologies to create the web applications.

                            This is a hobby project created to help with the
                            quality of life for staff and customers of Reece.
                            The web application utilises NodeJS and Express as
                            the backbone of the app. To seed the data of the
                            application, I built my own web scraper using Scrapy
                            and Zyte. The database is hosted on Mongo Atlas as a
                            clone of my local database. To style the web
                            application, I used SASS pre-processing. The website
                            uses a form input to filter through the database and
                            return the results of the form for what toilet will
                            suit the current layout.

                        <p>
                            This is a code project to demonstrate using Express,
                            Node and MySQL. It adds a user email to the project
                            and displays how many users are currently stored in
                            the database. It uses Bootstrap5 to create the
                            styling of the webpage.
